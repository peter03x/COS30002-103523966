Task 5 Lab Note
1. DFS:
    This search method starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
    This strategy allows it to travel deep into the graph quicly.
    Use case: When the programmer wants to explore all the possibilities before backing up
2. BFS
    This search method starts at the root node and explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next location to explore.
3. SearchAStar
    This search method is widely used when people want to find path and traverse through graph. It use a heuristic to estimate how close the end goal is from a certain node. It's faster and more efficient than BFS
4. Dijkstra
    This search method is used for findingg the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Compared to BFS, it accounts for weighted paths, allowing it to determine the shortest path by distance, not simply the fewest edges.
